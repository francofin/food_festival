The client wants us to do everything we can to prevent network connectivity problems from interfering with the user experience.
 We can't exactly guarantee internet service for everyoneâ€”but we can 
 enable users to access and use the app even without an internet connection.

 We'll accomplish this goal using service workers. Service workers are background scripts that run in the browser, 
 separate from the JavaScript. Service workers can do many things, 
 but most useful to us is their ability to intercept network requests and serve data from the browser cache.
